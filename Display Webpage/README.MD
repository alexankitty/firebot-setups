# Firebot Webpage Display
By Alexankitty
Gives a simple MixItUp style option to display a webpage in the overlay.

## For anchors use the following:
Top Bottom Middle for vertical (Y axis) position
Left Right Center for Horizontal (X axis) position

Ex: topright for the topright corner of the screen
Ex: middlecenter for the middle of the screen

Center positioning is based on top left positioning. Use a negative value to position in the opposite direction.
Height, Width, X, and Y values all accept CSS Units, or if none are present are assumed to be px.

Features random instantiation and cleanup. Won't conflict or alter already running displayed webpages.
